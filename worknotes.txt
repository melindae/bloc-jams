Original answer---

When I remove .thumb from within the mousedown function it still works because .find('.thumb') had already returned it.

I think we add it to ensure that if we include any other click events later there's no confusion. Be more specific just in case.

Namespacing! Ah, so later, when we've added more events, we might not want to unbind, etc, mousemove/up/down globally so we toss a .thumb on to restrict the functions.

I bound mousemove and mouseup to ('.player-bar') instead of (document). There was no behavior change that I could see. But if we put another bar elsewhere we would either have to recreate the function or re-expand it to cover. Also, we lose the .unbind for the rest of the page. And that could get messy.


showing the mouse X,Y coords:
```
$(document).mousemove(function(event) {
  console.log(event.pageX, event.pageY); 
})
```
Then I threw in an identifier to print out and found that it slowed things down a bit.
```
$(document).mousemove(function(event) {
  console.log('X ' + event.pageX, 'Y ' + event.pageY); 
})
```
